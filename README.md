A website project that will allow for students to manage anxiety and or relax after a stressful exam/study sessions. 
The site will be using the box breathing method to allow students to relax by following the technique.

V0.01 notes: 
This is still the test one that Chris uploaded however I have made a few adjustments. 
I created a footer which stores the links to our githubs and created a class for the footer and for the links.
The class for the footer makes sure that the footer will be at the bottom of the page and centered at all times.
The class for the links makes sure when the links aren't being hovered over they have no underlinning or colour differences but when they are being hovered or clicked they have underlinning and colour changes between them.
I also created a folder system so that our main HTML just goes inside the main and our CSS and JS goes into seperate folders just remember to put file directorys when linking CSS and JS.
