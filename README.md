# lax-study
A website project that will allow for students to manage anxiety and or relax after a stressful exam/study sessions. 
The site will be using the box breathing method to allow students to relax by following the technique.

V0.01 notes: 
This is still the test one that Chris uploaded however I have made a few adjustments. 
I created a footer which stores the links to our githubs and created a class for the footer and for the links.
The class for the footer makes sure that the footer will be at the bottom of the page and centered at all times.
The class for the links makes sure when the links aren't being hovered over they have no underlinning or colour differences but when they are being hovered or clicked they have underlinning and colour changes between them.
I also created a folder system so that our main HTML just goes inside the main and our CSS and JS goes into seperate folders just remember to put file directorys when linking CSS and JS.

V0.02 notes:
I have built functionality into the button by creating a new JS file which allows for the button to disappear upon being clicked.
I have added the countdown id so that a countdown can be displayed on the webpage.
Additional functionality has also been added to the button, that when clicked it should also begin a basic countdown(this is style a prototype) counting down from 5. Upon reaching 0 the countdown will end.
The countdown should also be hidden when it reaches 0. This will allow for the box breathing meditation to begin. Functionality will need to be added so that after the countdown a counter starts to track how long they have meditated over the course of their "session".

I have worked on a bit of css that allows for a box to rotate for a minute. I still have to get it to work without the user hovering over it however it is fully operational all that is left to do is centre it and that should be us.

V0.04 notes:
Added extra buttons(yes and no) and a sentence which will be displayed after the meditation completes
Added functionality to the main button to get the box animation to appear after being clicked and the countdown has been completed.
